# Linear Regression Model 
### Setup and Running the Code
To set up and run this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository using git clone.
2. Install the required dependencies using cargo build.
3. Run the code using cargo run.
4. The program will generate synthetic data, train a linear regression model, and plot the results.
### Approach and Challenges
To solve this problem, I approached it by breaking it down into smaller tasks:
1. Generating synthetic data using a simple linear regression formula.
2. Implementing a linear regression model from scratch.
3. Training the model using gradient descent.
4. Evaluating the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. Plotting the results using the textplots crate.
##### I faced several challenges during this project:
1. Implementing the linear regression formula correctly.
2. Debugging issues with the gradient descent algorithm.
3. Understanding how to use the textplots crate to plot the results.
### Resources Used
I used the following resources to help me complete this project:
1. Rust documentation: https://doc.rust-lang.org/ 
2. textplots crate documentation: https://crates.io/crates/textplots
3. Linear regression tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/linear-regression-in-rust-33e4c7e4f6a
### Reflection on Learning
1. Online resources, including documentation and tutorials, significantly helped me.
2. I also relied on AI-powered tools like code completion and debugging assistance.
3. Through this project, I learned the importance of:
1. Breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks.
2. Debugging and testing code thoroughly.
3. Seeking help from online resources and communities.
